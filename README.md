# Fine Tuning LLMs

I learned about fine tuning in detail and did this project as an implementation. We can fine tune a model by any of the three ways:
- Self-supervised
- Supervised
- Reinforcement Learning

There are options for parameter training also:
- __Retrain all parameters__
        which is computationally expensive
- __Transfer Learning__
- __Parameter Efficient Finetuning__(PERT)
        I used this using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
